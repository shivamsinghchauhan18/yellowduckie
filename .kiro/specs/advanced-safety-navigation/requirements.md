# Advanced Safety Navigation System - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the existing Duckietown Safe Navigation system with advanced safety features, dynamic lane changing capabilities, and state-of-the-art autonomous navigation while maintaining its proven real-world functionality on physical Duckiebots. The enhancement will be modular, incremental, and thoroughly tested to ensure the system remains operational throughout development.

## Requirements

3. WHEN the safety system is active THEN the system SHALL maintain a minimum safe distance of 0.3 meters from any detected obstacle
4. IF a potential collision is predicted THEN the system SHALL activate predictive braking before the obstacle enters the critical zone
5. WHEN safety systems are engaged THEN the system SHALL log all safety events for analysis and debugging

### Requirement 2: Dynamic Lane Changing

**User Story:** As a Duckiebot operator, I want the robot to intelligently change lanes when necessary, so that it can navigate around obstacles and optimize its path while maintaining safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an obstacle blocks the current lane for more than 3 seconds THEN the system SHALL evaluate lane change feasibility
2. WHEN changing lanes THEN the system SHALL signal the intention using LED patterns for at least 2 seconds before initiating the maneuver
3. WHEN a lane change is initiated THEN the system SHALL complete the maneuver within 8 seconds or abort safely
4. IF the adjacent lane is occupied or unsafe THEN the system SHALL remain in the current lane and wait for a safe opportunity
5. WHEN lane changing THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth trajectory control with maximum lateral acceleration of 0.5 m/s²

### Requirement 3: Advanced Perception and Prediction

**User Story:** As a Duckiebot operator, I want the robot to predict the behavior of other vehicles and pedestrians, so that it can make proactive navigation decisions and avoid potential conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN other vehicles are detected THEN the system SHALL track their position, velocity, and predicted trajectory for at least 3 seconds
2. WHEN a vehicle's trajectory intersects with the robot's path THEN the system SHALL predict the collision risk and adjust accordingly
3. WHEN multiple objects are in the scene THEN the system SHALL maintain tracking of up to 5 objects simultaneously
4. IF tracking confidence drops below 70% THEN the system SHALL increase safety margins and reduce speed by 50%
5. WHEN prediction algorithms are running THEN the system SHALL update predictions at least 10 Hz

### Requirement 4: Adaptive Speed Control

**User Story:** As a Duckiebot operator, I want the robot to dynamically adjust its speed based on environmental conditions, so that it maintains optimal performance while ensuring safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN visibility is reduced (detected through image analysis) THEN the system SHALL reduce maximum speed by 30%
2. WHEN approaching intersections THEN the system SHALL reduce speed to 0.1 m/s within 0.5 meters of the stop line
3. WHEN following another vehicle THEN the system SHALL maintain a time-based following distance of 2 seconds minimum
4. IF multiple safety factors are present THEN the system SHALL apply the most restrictive speed limit
5. WHEN speed adjustments are made THEN the system SHALL ensure smooth acceleration/deceleration with maximum change rate of 0.3 m/s²

### Requirement 5: Intelligent Intersection Navigation

**User Story:** As a Duckiebot operator, I want the robot to navigate intersections with advanced decision-making capabilities, so that it can handle complex traffic scenarios safely and efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN approaching an intersection THEN the system SHALL scan for other vehicles in all directions for at least 2 seconds
2. WHEN multiple vehicles arrive at an intersection simultaneously THEN the system SHALL follow right-of-way rules and yield appropriately
3. WHEN turning at intersections THEN the system SHALL check for oncoming traffic and pedestrians before proceeding
4. IF intersection conditions are unclear or unsafe THEN the system SHALL wait until conditions improve before proceeding
5. WHEN navigating intersections THEN the system SHALL complete the maneuver within 15 seconds or signal for assistance

### Requirement 6: Robust Communication and Coordination

**User Story:** As a Duckiebot operator, I want the robot to communicate its intentions clearly to other vehicles and infrastructure, so that coordinated navigation can be achieved safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN changing lanes or turning THEN the system SHALL use LED signals that are visible from at least 2 meters distance
2. WHEN stopped due to obstacles THEN the system SHALL activate hazard lights to warn other vehicles
3. WHEN following another vehicle THEN the system SHALL maintain visual contact and respond to the lead vehicle's signals
4. IF communication with other vehicles is possible THEN the system SHALL share position and intention data
5. WHEN in emergency situations THEN the system SHALL activate distinctive warning patterns on all LEDs

### Requirement 7: System Monitoring and Diagnostics

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring of all safety and navigation systems, so that I can ensure reliable operation and quickly diagnose any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any safety system activates THEN the system SHALL log the event with timestamp, sensor data, and system response
2. WHEN system performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert operators and switch to safe mode operation
3. WHEN running diagnostics THEN the system SHALL verify all sensors, actuators, and safety systems within 30 seconds
4. IF critical systems fail THEN the system SHALL immediately stop and activate emergency protocols
5. WHEN monitoring is active THEN the system SHALL provide real-time status updates at 1 Hz frequency

### Requirement 8: Modular Architecture Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the enhanced features to be implemented as modular components, so that they can be easily tested, maintained, and deployed without disrupting existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new safety modules are added THEN they SHALL integrate seamlessly with existing ROS nodes without breaking current functionality
2. WHEN modules are updated THEN the system SHALL support hot-swapping without requiring full system restart
3. WHEN testing new features THEN they SHALL be deployable in isolated test modes that don't affect core navigation
4. IF a new module fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to previous functionality level
5. WHEN deploying updates THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing configurations

### Requirement 9: Real-World Validation and Testing

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive testing capabilities for all new features, so that I can validate system performance in real-world conditions before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new features are implemented THEN they SHALL be testable in simulation before real-world deployment
2. WHEN conducting real-world tests THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive logging and performance metrics
3. WHEN safety features are tested THEN they SHALL demonstrate reliable operation in at least 100 test scenarios

5. WHEN validation is complete THEN the system SHALL provide certification reports for all safety-critical features

### Requirement 10: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the enhanced system to maintain or improve performance efficiency, so that battery life and computational resources are optimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN advanced features are active THEN the system SHALL maintain at least 90% of original battery life performance
2. WHEN processing multiple sensor inputs THEN the system SHALL maintain real-time performance with latency under 100ms
3. WHEN running on limited computational resources THEN the system SHALL prioritize safety-critical functions over convenience features
4. IF computational load exceeds 80% THEN the system SHALL automatically optimize by reducing non-essential processing
5. WHEN optimizations are applied THEN the system SHALL maintain full safety functionality without compromise
